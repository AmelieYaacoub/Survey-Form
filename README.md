# Survey Form

**Survey Form by Am√©lie Yaacoub | [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Project | February 2020**

I started to teach myself more about the frameworks, programming languages and front-end applications.
For this I use free online tutorials like Free Code Camp and share my results on GitHub.

I have always been curious and very self-organized and love to teach myself new things. I am convinced that it is never too late to start something new! :)

So I tried out the Free Code Camp Challenges..

## The Challenge
The Responsive Web Design Certification from Free Code Camp includes five final projects to apply the learned skills.
### Project One
On the [second project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form) you have to build a Survey Form for something you like, but it should be functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP).

### What is my Survey Form about?
My survey is focused on ice cream. Because ice cream is great.

## Learned Skills

My Survey Form includes:

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- jQuery
